They have the personal resilience and confidence to persist when others doubt them but the humility to acknowledge that they are not always right, and turn their mistakes into learning opportunities.</p><p><strong>Judgement</strong></p><p>Part of the fundamental role of a leader in social care is to make sound judgements and manage risks effectively. This judgement should be based upon evidence, knowledge and experience. It involves being open to hearing and considering the views of others. For example, a team manager in social care needs to take into account information from the social worker, who knows the service user well and consider their assessment of risks. Leadership in this situation is about instilling confidence in others around and making robust judgements.</p><p>Good leaders are able to engage others. They use skills to engage people in a way that makes them feel part of the decision-making process. It gains their commitment to the direction the organisation is taking. This is often referred to as a psychological contract. Organisational behaviourists, Edgar Schein and Chris Argyris, conducted many studies in the 1960s, focusing on the relationship between employees and leaders in organisations. The psychological contract refers to the relationship between an employer and its employees and specifically concerns mutual expectations of inputs and outcomes.</p><p>Engagement is also about actively listening to others. This means being present when with them and completely aware of what’s happening. It means paying attention to what’s going on, rather than being caught up in your thoughts and letting your mind wander.</p>",
